#Use the RPI image with desktop applications so that VNC is already installed

#connecting RPI to Wifi

#After loading the RPI image on the SD card, open the SD card contents and create a new file by the name: wpa_supplicant.conf
#When using windows make sure that the file extension is not .txt when saving the file with this name. Select file type as "All files" when saving
#wpa_supplicant.conf file should have the following contents. Use your specific 2 digit country code:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US 

network={
        ssid="Your WIFI SSID name here" 
        psk="Your Wifi password here" 
        
}


#similarly create one more file named just "ssh" with no contents. By doing this, SSH will be enabled on boot. File type should be not be a text file
#Pi will connect to the wifi and we can ssh into the pi now to do VNC server settings to access the user interface

#setting up VNC server to connect remotely:
#use the following command to run VNC server on pi manually. This will confirm that VNC is installed and ready to be used

VNCSERVER :1

#if you try to run the same command, it will throw and error that VNCserver is already running.
# Steps shown below will start VNC server upon boot:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local     #open file to make changes

#Enter the following before the line that says "Exit 0"
su - pi -c '/usr/bin/tightvncserver :1'

# PI will now start VNC server upon boot
#use IP address of PI followed by :1 to access the GUI. Ex. 192.168.1.105:1
